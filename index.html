    <h1><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h1>
    <p>The highest level of education I reached is high school, I went through my primary school in an academy called Whitestar situated in Langata. My high school period i learnt in Kakamega in Mukumu high school. I have no job experience. I decided to take a class on programming because i had a passion of computer and also i wanted to know how to code so as to persue my dream goal (being a web designer).</p>
